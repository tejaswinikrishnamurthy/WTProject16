			  <h2> The game has the following mechanics</h2>
			<ul>
			  <h3> 
			   <li> A small paddle is controlled by the player and can only move within the bounds of the screen; either left or right.</li>
			   <li> The ball tracels across the screen and each collision results in the ball changing its direction based on on where it hit;this applies to the screen bounds, the bricks and the paddle.</li>
			   <li> If the ball reaches the bottom edge of the screen, the player is either game over or loses a life.</li>
			   <li> As soon as a brick touches the ball, it is destroyed,</li>
			   <li> The player wins as soon as all the bricks are destroye.</li>
			   <li> The direction of the ball can be manipulated by how far the ball bounces from the paddle's center.</li>
			  <h3>
			  </br></br></br>
			  <h3> Use right arrow key (->) to move the paddle right.
			  </br></br>
				   Use left arrow key (<-) to move the paddle left.</h3>
			<ul>
